Analyzed an online retail dataset using Python to uncover key business insights. Conducted univariate analysis to identify top-selling products, total sales trends, and country-wise performance. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied to explore relationships such as unit price vs. quantity sold and the combined impact of country and product category on revenue. The data was cleaned and preprocessed from Excel, with missing values and duplicates handled appropriately. Visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps were created to present findings clearly. The analysis led to actionable insights, including high-revenue product categories and top-performing regions.
